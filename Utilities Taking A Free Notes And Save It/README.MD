# TAKING A NOTES
A test module to take notes freely and save it for later use. The intent for this module is for a game where players need to pay attention to the conversations, and maybe take a notes of those conversations in case it became important later on when they facing a live-changin decision. The game could gave some hints to the players of such conversations, or when they about to face such decisions, e.g:
1. Give the players option to check the notes before facing important decision (this decision could be timed too!)
2. Make the sentences clear that this is an important information (could be with or without any visual hints), etc
