# VN STYLE DIALOGUE TEST
* Add-ons
    * [Dialogue Manager]("https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager")
    * [Dialogic]("https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic")

## What Is This?
This is a test project to play around with Godot's dialogue addons to kind of see whether this can fullfil my project's requirements, the bottlenecks, etc. In this, I will also try cross-language scripting with GDScript for main dialogue, and C# for anything else aside.
